* Run the code file 'Lead Scoring Case Study' with 'Lead.csv' as input file.

## Problem statement - 
An education company called X education which sells online courses to industry professionals is suffering from poor conversion rates to their courses. So, they want us to build a model which helps them identify their most potential leads ('Hot leads'), so that they can be targeted easily by the Sales team to increase their conversion rate.

## Methodology - 

1. Reading and Understanding the data
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Preparation
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression)
5. Model Evaluation

## Results - 
The average `Lead_Score` of the converted is around 60 and that of not converted is around 20. So, the sales team can focus on leads with `Lead_score` of around 60 to improve their conversion rate.
